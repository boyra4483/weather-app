# Weather App

A single-page weather application built with React and `react-router-dom`, which allows users to search for current weather data using **any keyword** — not just real cities or countries.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌤 Get current weather by entering any word (e.g., `"Paris"`, `"bucket"`, `"horse"` — if the API can interpret it).
- ⚛️ Built as a **SPA** (Single Page Application) using **React** and **React Router DOM**.
- 🔄 Dynamic routing for search results.
- 🧠 Fuzzy or broad search capability, depending on what the API accepts.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Fetch API** or your HTTP client of choice
- **CSS Modules** / Tailwind / plain CSS (update based on what you used)
- Weather data from [your API provider here] (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
